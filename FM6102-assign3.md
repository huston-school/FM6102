# FM6102 Assignment Three: Multimodal Project

## Overview

You will develop a multimodal, digital work (examples: video essay, augmented reality, interactive installation, digital performance). This project should mark a departure in your practice to date and enable you to engage with an aspect of digital media that is novel for you. 

In addition to the project, you will submit an academic essay (2000 words) contextualising your project in the broader field of digital production, including examples of other relevant works and relevant scholarship cited appropriately using MLA. You are required to give a five minute presentation in the last week of class on your project.

## Deliverables

- Proposal (due 25 February) - 5% of project mark, marked pass/fail
- In class presentation (30 March) - 5% of project mark, marked pass/fail
- Project and 2000 word essay (29 April) - 90% of project mark, assessed using marking rubric below

The exact deliverable of your project is up to you. Since medium may vary, there are no prescribed guides on length or quantity, though it is asked that video and audio submissions do not exceed 10 minutes.
Note that your project can involve multiple parts, such as various images, sound recordings, videos, and so forth. If submitting such a project, please submit in a way that is easily navigable, such as a pdf document, website, or other form that guides delivery.

You may include the work of others as part of the project, but credit must be given for all contributions and these should be minor. Payment for work on project is not allowed. 

**You are welcome to collaborate with someone else in the module to create a project jointly.** Even though a single project can be submitted, each person will have to individually research and write an academic paper, within which details on contributions to project are presented along with other required criteria

### Proposal due Friday 25 February

150 to 250 word description of proposed project media and concepts to be explored. List of 3 relevant examples and 5 academic references. Marked pass/fail.

### Presentation

On March 30, you will each be presenting a short presentation on your project. These will take the form of a [Pecha Kucha](https://www.pechakucha.com/about), where you will each present 20 slides for 20 seconds each for 6 minutes and 40 seconds total. It is suggested that you prepare slides in Powerpoint or Keynote with automatic timing enabled. This will support you in sticking to the format more effectively. Here are some [tips on preparation](https://wiki.rice.edu/confluence/display/DMCGUIDES/Creating+a+Pecha+Kucha+Presentation+Using+PowerPoint)

There is no prescribed format for the content of the presentation. Use this it to present what you have at this stage including:

There is no prescribed format for the content of the presentation.  Use this it to present what you have at this stage including:

- your ideas for the project
- your influences and examples of existing works
- relevant theories and concepts from the module
- any content you may have at this stage (this will vary depending on what stage you are at with the project)
- how you hope to present the final output, which can include descriptions, mock ups, or possibilities
- identify any specific areas that you want feedback on at this stage

The purpose of this presentation is to help you further develop your ideas, support you in outlining for the written essay component of the project, and to get some feedback on your project at this stage. Think of it as a chance. Remember, the presentation is marked pass/fail, so it is a useful opportunity to give your ideas a test run and to get some in-process feedback from the class before you complete your project and paper.  

### Academic Essay

- State of the art: discuss the type of media you are engaging with, including description of media with reference to three relevant examples and [scholarly sources](https://libguides.library.nuigalway.ie/research-skills/types-of-sources) (from module reading list and own research; at least 5). Use relevant concepts from class to direct your discussion (ie. play, aesthetics, creativity, media geologies, materiality, interactivity, performance, ubiquity). You may select one or several concepts, but use discretion and ensure relevance through the articulation of a cohesive argument (750 words).
- Method: Present overview of practice-based research and method of production. Note that this is not a journal, but involves reflexive engagement with the process. When pertinent, relate to relevant theories identified in the state of the art section (500 words)
- Discussion/Analysis: Review findings from research. How does the project relate to concepts and ideas from class that you have identified in the state of the art? How does it build upon or respond to existing research? How do you relate it the examples you presented? (500 words)
- Conclusion: Summarise findings and discuss potential future avenues for research and/or other applications (125 words)

Essay must be cited in [MLA and include a works cited list](https://libguides.library.nuigalway.ie/research-skills/citingandreferencing)
