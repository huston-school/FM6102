# FM6102 Assignment Three: Multimodal Project

## Overview

You will develop a multimodal, digital work (examples: video essay, augmented reality, interactive installation, digital performance). This project should mark a departure in your practice to date and enable you to engage with an aspect of digital media that is novel for you. 

In addition to the project, you will submit an academic essay (2000 words) contextualising your project in the broader field of digital production, including examples of other relevant works and relevant scholarship cited appropriately using MLA. You are required to give a five minute presentation in the last week of class on your project.

## Deliverables

- Proposal (due 25 February) - 5% of project mark, marked pass/fail
- In class presentation (30 March) - 5% of project mark, marked pass/fail
- Project and 2000 word essay (29 April) - 90% of project mark, assessed using marking rubric below

The exact deliverable of your project is up to you. Since medium may vary, there are no prescribed guides on length or quantity, though it is asked that video and audio submissions do not exceed 10 minutes.
Note that your project can involve multiple parts, such as various images, sound recordings, videos, and so forth. If submitting such a project, please submit in a way that is easily navigable, such as a pdf document, website, or other form that guides delivery.

You may include the work of others as part of the project, but credit must be given for all contributions and these should be minor. Payment for work on project is not allowed.

### Proposal due Friday 25 February

150 to 250 word description of proposed project media and concepts to be explored. List of 3 relevant examples and 5 academic references.
