The 128×128 px greyscale camera was connected to the laboratory's local network through a video capture card fitted on an Acorn Archimedes computer

Taylor: "people were sensing the power they had to shift otherwise- instrumental encounters to more relational ones. Using the technology to talk to each other and connect, frequently across distances, became a central part of these early explorations" (30)

Sense of presence at a distance 

1990s - 2000s: great period of experimentation with cam culture

"Early cam culture highlights how average internet users in the 1990s were taking up various technologies, and mobilizing them to their own social and interactive ends. The power of televisually
connecting in real time with others, navigating a space of communication and performance simultaneously, and revealing otherwise- mundane but evocative daily life to others are lines that connect these older video experiments to current game live streaming" (Taylor 32).-->

## Private and Public Space

- Home broadcast studio:inviting the public into a private space
- Ana Voog, [Anacam (Archived version)](https://www.anavoog.com/anacam.com/index.html)
    - [Time lapse video](https://vimeo.com/58485273)
- On camera and behind the scenes work: managing chats, running ads, engaging with viewers, working with moderators -- "labor of producing one's pay for spectatorship" (Taylor 69).
    - traditional media production involved division of labour, but home studios require agility to take on multiple roles
- Crafting a professional identity: emotional labour
- "Live streaming, particularly when undertaken with professional aspirations, becomes the work of play" (Taylor 69)
- Balance between sharing and privacy: negotiation of public and private

## Layers of Production

- Set design
- Performance
- Critique and evaluation
- Sociality
- Material and digital infrastructure
- Economic and commercial frameworks

<!-- "The level of technicity— “particular kinds of attitudes, aptitudes, and skill, with technology” (Dovey and Kennedy 2006, 113)— involved in making more complex streams is key, and typically requires a tremendous amount of self- taught expertise and community- based learning" (Taylor 79) -- similar with Cam culture -->

## Experiences of viewing

- Creating connections
- Hunter challenges privileging of proximity: important to acknowledge what is unavailable
- Different types of engagement: flow or discordant
- New means of affective engagement: ["Zoom fatigue"](https://tmb.apaopen.org/pub/nonverbal-overload/release/2) and ["Zoom bomb"](https://academic.oup.com/ccc/article/14/2/356/6224211?login=true)
