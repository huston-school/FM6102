## Module Overview

This module aims to explore the landscape of current innovations in digital media technologies across a range of arts disciplines. The module will explore emerging technologies in digital arts and media, examining historical precedence in creative innovation and considering on-going experimentations. Students will utilise a practice-based research approach to develop experimental project prototypes. Forms of technological exploration will include video art, data visualisation, interactive media, locative media, installation, physical computing, and performance. The module poses questions of the materiality of these new forms of technology, critical and contextual issues arising from these technologies and the experiences they create. It presents the student with the opportunity to map these technologies to their own practice and discipline and to discover innovation therein. The module aims to encourage peer collaboration, idea generation and innovation. It also requires students to independently research and analyse the current and future trends, possibilities and impact of technologies on their respective disciplines.
